# Bee Image Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying images as containing bees versus non-bees (including bee mimics) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. It includes scripts for loading and preprocessing image data, training a model (D1), and an API for real-time video frame classification (which currently uses a D2 model).

            *   `BatchNormalization()`.
            *   `Activation('relu')`.
            *   `Dropout(0.5)`: For regularization to prevent overfitting.
        *   `Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')`: Output layer for binary classification.

        *   Optimizer: `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` using the learning rate schedule.
        *   Loss: `binary_crossentropy` (suitable for binary classification).
        *   Metrics: `accuracy`, `tf.keras.metrics.Precision(name='precision')`, `tf.keras.metrics.Recall(name='recall')`, `tf.keras.metrics.AUC(name='auc')`.

        *   Training data: `X_train`, `y_train`.
        *   Validation data: `X_test`, `y_test`.
        *   Epochs: `EPOCHS`.
        *   Batch size: `BATCH_SIZE`.
        *   Callbacks: `tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping` (patience=5, `restore_best_weights=True`) to stop training if validation performance doesn't improve and keep the best model.
    3.  Evaluates the model on the test set (`model.evaluate()`) and prints the evaluation results for each metric.
    4.  Creates the model saving directory (`MODEL_D1_DIR`) if it doesn't exist.
    5.  Saves the trained model to `MODEL_D1_FILE` using `model.save()`.

### `api.py`
*   **Purpose**: Implements a FastAPI application to serve the bee classification model over a WebSocket for real-time video frame analysis.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   `FastAPI` app initialization with title, description, and version.
    *   **`get_model()`**:
        *   Loads a TensorFlow model.
    *   **`@app.websocket('/ws/video')`**:
        *   Defines a WebSocket endpoint.
        *   Accepts WebSocket connections.
        *   Enters a loop to continuously receive byte data (video frames).
        *   Decodes the byte data into an image frame using `cv2.imdecode()`.
        *   **TODO**: The frame processing and model prediction logic within the WebSocket loop is currently incomplete. It receives the frame but doesn't yet preprocess it for the model or send back a classification.
        *   Includes basic error handling for invalid frames.
        *   Handles `WebSocketDisconnect`.
    *   **`@app.get('/health')`**:
        *   A simple HTTP GET endpoint to check if the API is running. Returns `{'status': 'ok'}`.
    *   `uvicorn.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)`: Starts the FastAPI application using Uvicorn ASGI server, making it accessible on all network interfaces on port 8000.


## How to Run

### 1. Training the D1 Model:
  This step only needs to be done if the model is not already trained and saved
  Ensure your `Data/dataset_1` directory is populated with `bee`, `non_bee`, and `mimics` subdirectories containing images.
  ```bash
   python main.py
  ```
   This will:
   *   Load and preprocess images from `Data/dataset_1`.
   *   Define and compile the D1 CNN model.
   *   Train the model, evaluate it, and print metrics.
   *   Save the trained model to `model/D1`.

### 2. Running the API:
   **Important:** The API currently tries to load a model from `model/D1`. Make sure a compatible TensorFlow SavedModel exists
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```
   The API will start, and you can connect to the WebSocket endpoint `/ws/video` (e.g., using a JavaScript client) to send video frames for classification. You can also check the health at `http://localhost:8000/health`.
